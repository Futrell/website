 Edoardo is a third-year Ph.D. student in Computational Linguistics at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), where he is part of [St John's College](https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/). He is supervised by Prof. [Anna Korhonen](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~alk23/) and funded through the ERC project [LEXICAL](http://ltl.mml.cam.ac.uk/projects/lexical/). He has previously interned as an AI/ML researcher at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) in Cupertino, and been awarded a [Google Research Faculty Award](https://ai.google/research/outreach/faculty-research-awards/) for a project co-written with his supervisor. His research focuses on few-shot multilingual learning and on the specialization of distributional word representations with structured knowledge.
