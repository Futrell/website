abstract: "The performance of machine translation systems is commonly evaluated in terms of BLEU scores (Papineni et al., 2002). However, due to its asymmetric formulation, BLEU does not allow an assessment of which translation directions are more difficult to model. In this paper, we propose a symmetric, information-theoretic measure based on mutual information, that allows us to properly evaluate the difficulty of generating text in the target language by removing the effect of the difficulty of the language modelling component. We then present the first systematic and controlled study of cross-lingual translation difficulties using modern state-of-the-art systems."
