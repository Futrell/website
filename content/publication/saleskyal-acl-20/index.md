abstract: "A major hurdle in data-driven research on typology is data availability in many diverse languages. We present the first large-scale corpus for phonetic typology, with aligned phone segments and phonetic measures for vowels and sibilants in >600 languages. Extending extraction procedures to new and particularly low-resource languages is non-trivial and computationally-intensive; releasing token-level measurements enables far greater research accessibility in this area. This resource is the first of its kind and will enable investigation of phonetic typology at a much larger scale and across many languages for which previous resources do not exist. We describe the methodology to create our corpus, VoxClamantis, and illustrate research it enables through a series of case studies. Our corpus and scripts are publicly available for non-commercial use at https://voxclamantisproject.github.io."
